\chapter{Selected Controller Capabilities}
\label{chap:nics}

This chapter documents the features of contemporary \a{NIC}s with respect to
offloading. We have chosen the following controllers for thorough analysis:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Intel 82599 10 Gigabit Ethernet Controller
	\item Intel Ethernet Controller XL710
	\item Mellanox ConnectX-4
	\item Chelsio Terminator 6
	\item Netronome NFP-6000
\end{itemize}

The selection was influenced by the support for match-action offloading, which is the
primary focus of the thesis. We have chosen the most recent controllers
supported by the Linux kernel. The order is arbitrary, though we preferred
controllers with publicly available specifications, as we know more about them.
