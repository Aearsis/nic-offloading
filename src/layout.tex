% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
%	Network interface controllers assist the host with
%	packet processing. For modern controlle lers, these features include
%	increasingly flexible classification and modification of packets. At the present time, the Linux
%	kernel utilizes these features only by offloading the work of the Traffic
%	Control subsystem, which was designed for a completely different purpose,
%	making the offload hard to understand for users and unnecessarily complex for drivers.
%
%	This thesis proposes a new subsystem that would allow utilization of features of
%	modern controllers, while avoiding the problems that come with offloading
%	Traffic Control. Five high-end controllers were examined and their
%	capabilities were determined in detail. The information
%	about these controllers, extracted from datasheets and source codes, is
%	also included in the thesis. Finally, as there is no extensive up-to-date
%	overview of the current hardware offloading techniques, we start by
%	introducing the reader to them in general.
	Modern network interface controllers allow the host to offload packet
	processing to hardware in order to improve performance. At the present
	time, the advanced features are utilized in the Linux kernel by offloading
	the Traffic Control subsystem. Since this subsystem has been designed for
	a completely different purpose, its usage for hardware offloading is
	impractical and unreliable. Furthermore, in its current state the subsystem
	is not capable of utilizing all hardware features, which are often poorly
	documented.

	The presented work adopts a different approach to the problem. Five
	high-end controllers and their packet-processing pipelines were examined in
	detail. Accounting for their projected future development, common traits
	and features were identified. The researched information was used to draft
	a proposal for a new Linux subsystem, more compatible with hardware
	offloading than the current solution. The proposed subsystem defines
	a sufficiently descriptive interface to utilize the majority of
	hardware-offloaded features while avoiding common problems caused by
	excessively generalized approach of Traffic Control.
